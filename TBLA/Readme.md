## Implementation
1. For user login or signup 
```python
from tbla import Authenticate

user = Authenticate("youremail@example.com", "yourpassword")
user.login() # For login old users
user.signup() # For new user creation

user.save("filepath/filename.extension")
# Use it for saving user information

```
2. For Tree Branch and Leaf Creation
(While login/signup)
```python
from tbla import Authenticate, Tree
user = Authenticate("youremail@example.com", "yourpassword")
user.login() # For login old users
user.signup() # For new user creation

myTree = Tree("Treename", "TreePassword", user.login()) # or user.signup()


```


>This line ```myTree = Tree("Treename", "TreePassword", user.login()) # or user.signup()```
will create a tree in your account with Treename and TreePassword as Treename and password.<br>
Think of it as a **database name** and **database password**
